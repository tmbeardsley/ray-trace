## 1. Description
This repository follows the 3D ray tracing guide: "<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html" target="_blank">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>" by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch.
<br><br>
In addition to the code provided in the book, I have added extra comments and split progress up into chapters (multiple branches). 
There is also a "maths_scribbles" folder that derives some of the mathematical equations that were only stated in the book, as well as some of the more important diagrams.
